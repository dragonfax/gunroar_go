A quick port of Kenta Cho's "Gunroar" to Go.

The game runs, but its still full of bugs and missing features. 

The source was updated to SDL 2.0 along the way.

See readme_e.txt for the original README in english.

See the github issues for bugs still present or features broken from the original version.
