A quick port of Kenta Cho's "Gunroar" to Go.

The game runs, but its still full of bugs and missing features. 

The source was updated to SDL 2.0 along the way.

See readme_e.txt for the original README in english.


**BUGz**

* enemies display too large
* some enemies can't be shot or collided against
* can pass through land from below
* restarting mid-game doesn't reset game
* restor command line options
