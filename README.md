A quick port of Kenta Cho's "Gunroar" to Go.

The game runs, but its still full of bugs.  The translation was mostly literal, 
but some design patterns were changed and a bunch of features were removed.

See readme_e.txt for the original README in english.


BUGz & TODOs

* enemies display too large
* can pass through enemies from below
* glClear panics randomly

PUT BACK IN

* command line options
* replay recording
